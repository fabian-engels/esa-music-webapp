=Enable Remote Administration=
GlassFish 3.1.2+ does not allow remote administration out-of-the-box. To activate remote administration you will have to set an admin password before performing the actual enabling:


{{{
asadmin change-admin-password --domain_name [DOMAIN_NAME]

asadmin enable-secure-admin --port [PORT_NAME]
}}}
